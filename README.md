# TEAM AGEMY, THE FAMILY OF 2024 RILEY CHILDREN'S FOUNDATION CHAMPION, AMIR AGEMY!

Team Agemy has created this website for the sole purpose of having ads blasted on this website, and the more it's viewed, the more that donated to Riley Children's Foundation, in honor of Amir Agemy a 2024 Riley Children's Foundation Champion (Riley Champion).

In late 2023, the Agemy family received a call from someone at the Riley Children's Foundation notifying them that Amir had been chosen as a Riley Champion. Included in being a Riley Champion, Amir and his father, Samer were brought out onto the fifty-yard line where Amir had then been escorted with nine other kids to be near the LA Rams & Colts players while they had done the coin toss at the start of the game.

It's been an honor to be a part of Team Agemy and help Riley kids like Amir, who have gone through horrible things nobody should have to go through.
